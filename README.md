System for 2D role-playing games

# System requirements
Due to [Issue #1360](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/1360) in Bevy, ARM64 OSX systems currently require cmake
to be installed for the project to build. Presumably having the Vulkan SDK installed should also solve the problem, but
this is unconfirmed.
